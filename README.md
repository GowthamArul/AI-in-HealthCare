# AI in HealthCare

• Deep learning has been proven to be superior in detecting diseases from X-rays, MRI scans and CT scans which could significantly improve the speed and accuracy of diagnosis.

• In this project provided with 3929 Brain MRI scans along with their brain tumour location.

## Transfer Learning

• Transfer learning is a machine learning technique in which a network that has been trained to perform a specific task is being reused (repurposed) as a starting point for another similar task.

• Transfer learning is widely used since starting from a pretrained models can dramatically reduce the computational time required if training is performed from scratch.
